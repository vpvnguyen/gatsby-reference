### Core technologies

- HTML: A markup language that every web browser is able to understand. It stands for HyperText Markup Language. HTML gives your web content a universal informational structure, defining things like headings, paragraphs, and more.
- CSS: A presentational language used to style the appearance of your web content (fonts, colors, layout, etc). It stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
- JavaScript: A programming language that helps us make the web dynamic and interactive.
- React: A code library (built with JavaScript) for building user interfaces. It’s the framework that Gatsby uses to build pages and structure content.
- GraphQL: A query language that allows you to pull data into your website. It’s the interface that Gatsby uses for managing site data.
